# Garsington digital twin

Hi, this is the prototype that I built using Unity. Hope you enjoy it!
It was inspired by a render of "rehearsal room 1" that has been shared with my group by our contact.

### How to run:
1. Download the folder and unzip it
2. Launch garsington.exe
3. That's it !


### Keybinds:

W A S D to move around
Use mouse to look 
Shift to sprint
Space to jump
